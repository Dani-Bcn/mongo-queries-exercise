# MongoDB queries üîé

This repository is for my students at Ironhack, so that they can practise different MongoDB queries.

## Instructions

- Once you have forked and cloned the repository, write the following command on the terminal. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: for this command to work, your terminal should be on the repository project folder:

```bash
$ mongoimport --db people --collection users --file users.json
```

- This will create a database called "people" and a collection named "users". Once the process is finished, you should see a message telling you that 12 new documents were imported successfully.

- Open Mongo Compass and connect to the localhost database (mongodb://localhost:27017). Check the databases and make sure you see the "people" database.

- Now, open mongo shell on Mongo Compass or in the terminal and write the queries necessary to do the following actions. After each query, write your solution on the <code>answers.md</code> file for each iteration.

- Remember that, to operate on a specific collection of a specific database, you first have to "navigate" to it:

```bash
$ show dbs
$ use people
```


## Iteration 1

Write a query that finds all the users in the collection but returns only their names.



## Iteration 2

Write a query that finds all the users that currently have insurance.



## Iteration 3

Write a query that return all users that are 18 years old or older.

## Iteration 6

Write a query that returns those users of whom we have the phone number.



## Iteration 7

Write a query that updates the information of Marissa Geller: her new mail account is "marissa@hotmail.com".



## Iteration 8

## Iteration 9

Write a query that returns all the users living in the UK. Return only their names and currency.



## Iteration 10

Write a query that deletes all users that are older that are 45 or older.
